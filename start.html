                            A "pure" electric car has an electric motor turning the wheels instead of an engine.
                            The motor is powered by a large battery pack which can be recharged.
                             (There are also "hybrid" cars which have both an engine and a motor, but this site focuses on pure electric cars).
                              Up to recently, the mention of electric cars would make most people think of milk floats or golf carts.
                               The perception was of small cars with limited range. People had real fear, known as "range anxiety",
                                of being stranded with a flat battery. But some modern electric cars can drive 400kms (250 miles) or more.
                                On average, most drivers in Europe travel less than 100kms (62 miles) on a daily basis.

                            Electric cars are usually more expensive than a conventional petrol/diesel car of the same size.
                            But in many countries including Ireland, there are government grants available to reduce the cost.
                            They are being subsidised because they produce no harmful emissions. As electric cars become more
                            popular, they will become cheaper to manufacture, especially since they have much fewer moving parts
                            than conventional cars. As part of global action on climate change,authorities worldwide have set target dates up to 2040
                            to completely ban the sale of petrol/diesel fossil fuelled cars, while encouraging the take up of
                            electric cars. Norway is aiming for zero new fossil fuel cars sold as early as 2025.
