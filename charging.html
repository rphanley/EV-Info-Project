						How do I charge an electric car?
					</h3>

                    <p>There are a number of options for charging of electric cars. You can plug in to a wall
					    mounted charge point at home. On the road, you can charge at public charge points.
                        They offer either “rapid/fast” (DC,direct current) or “slow” (AC, alternating current)
                        charge rates. DC is faster, because it directly charges the battery pack. AC needs to
                        be converted to DC first, and is limited by mains wiring restrictions and the conversion by the car.

                <div class="col-sm-8">

                    <p>Rapid or Fast charge points are typically located at filling stations and motorway service areas. They can
                    directly charge the battery pack, supplying DC at rates of 50-150 kilowatts to charge a vehicle within an hour.
                    Slow chargers are smaller units, typically located at kerbside, car parks, train stations etc. They supply
                    AC to an on-board charging circuit in the car. The car converts this to DC to charge the battery pack.
                    Depending on the rating of the car, the charge can take place at up to 43 kW. The car can be fully charged
                    from empty in 3-4 hours.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>The diagram shows the most commonly used connectors used to charge electric vehicles (EVs). The layout of
                    each connector is shown in orange. For fast/rapid charging, the most commonly used connectors in Ireland are
                    CHAdeMO and CCS. Tesla cars can rapid charge at up to 120kW from Tesla superchargers. They can charge at
                    43kW from AC, where available. Newer models of the Renault Zoe have this capability also. The same type of
                    AC plug, known as "Type 2" is used to charge most electric cars at home via a removable cable. </p>

                    <p>Charging at home can be done overnight, and it makes sense to avail of night rate electricity if available.
                    The car may have a separate AC connector, this is connected to the wall mounted charger via the supplied cable.
                     For public charging, there may be a bigger connector also such as CHAdeMO or CCS. This is connected to a public
                     charge point via a heavier "tethered" cable attached to the charge point. The majority of public charge points are
                     owned by ESB Ecars. They are free to use at the moment, but a payment system is expected by the end of 2019. A swipe
                     card or phone app is required to use public charge points.</p>
